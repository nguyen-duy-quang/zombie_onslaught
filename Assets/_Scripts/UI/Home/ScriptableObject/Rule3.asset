  introduction: Welcome to the HARBOR OF HORRORS! Once a bustling port, this seaside
    haven has succumbed to the relentless tide of the undead. The once vibrant docks
    and warehouses now echo with the haunting groans of the zombie hordes. Navigate
    through the twisted wreckage of ships, dodging the remnants of a once-thriving
    maritime community now transformed into a nightmarish battleground. Brace yourself
    for the ultimate test of survival as you face the relentless onslaught of the
    living dead in this desolate and perilous harbor. Good luck, and may your aim
    be true in the face of this maritime nightmare!
